   
My ideea :

 

Creating a program  who calculate the generation 



 

 


must have : 


	
* User must input the Number to get output   ( Prompt() ) 

	
* Program takes only Interger  nubers not float, string , booleans , or other kinds of  datatypes 


	
*  fourmula or equation to use is 2 ^ x  // This show .......


	
* User get a output from prgram that tells him  how many ancestor you have and how many genration back it is   example : "About  X generation back you have Y ancestor "

psuedo Codes :

declaring a variable and defing it to userInput(Prompt())
